# React JS based NBA Player Strength Visualization 

## This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

* Created 4 extra filters and 2 shot themes(hexbin and scatter) to provide more customized visualization on the shotchart.
* Developed a autocomplete player search bar providing a list of players(image and name) in the suggestion list.
